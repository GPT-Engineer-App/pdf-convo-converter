# pdf-convo-converter

A user interface resembling a chat application that allows users to upload PDF files and converts chat conversations to PDF. The UI should have a dark theme with a prominent 'Upload PDF' button and a list displaying uploaded PDFs, akin to a chat interface. There should be a large, central panel that shows a preview of the selected PDF, and this panel should include a 'Smart Watch User Guide' as the default display. Features should include zoom controls, a page navigation system, and the ability to ask questions related to the PDF content, which are answered in a chat-like format. The overall design should be sleek and modern with a focus on usability.
